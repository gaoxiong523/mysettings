      <item value="&lt;code&gt;DocumentFilter&lt;/code&gt;, as the name implies, is a filter for the * &lt;code&gt;Document&lt;/code&gt; mutation methods.

The * default implementation allows the modification to * occur. Subclasses can filter the modifications by conditionally invoking * methods on the superclass, or invoking the necessary methods on * the passed in &lt;code&gt;FilterBypass&lt;/code&gt;.

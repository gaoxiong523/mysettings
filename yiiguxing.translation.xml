      <item value="Adjusters are a key tool for modifying temporal objects. * They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different * approaches, as per the strategy design pattern. * Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that * sets the date to the last day of the month." />

      <item value="Zero or more {@code RequestInterceptors} may be configured for purposes such as adding headers to * all requests. No guarantees are give with regards to the order that interceptors are applied. * Once interceptors are applied, {@link Target#apply(RequestTemplate)} is called to create the * immutable http request sent via {@link Client#execute(Request, feign.Request.Options)}. &lt;br&gt;" />
      <item value="An {@code int} value that may be updated atomically. See the * {@link java.util.concurrent.atomic} package specification for * description of the properties of atomic variables. An * {@code AtomicInteger} is used in applications such as atomically * incremented counters, and cannot be used as a replacement for an * {@link java.lang.Integer}. However, this class does extend * {@code Number} to allow uniform access by tools and utilities that * deal with numerically-based classes." />

      <item value="Here are the highlights of a class that uses an {@code Exchanger} * to swap buffers between threads so that the thread filling the * buffer gets a freshly emptied one when it needs it, handing off the * filled one to the thread emptying the buffer." />
      <item value="A synchronization point at which threads can pair and swap elements * within pairs. Each thread presents some object on entry to the * {@link #exchange exchange} method, matches with a partner thread, * and receives its partner's object on return.

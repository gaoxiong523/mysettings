      <item value="&lt;p&gt;Usages of this class should typically be of the form: * {@code ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextX(...)} (where * {@code X} is {@code Int}, {@code Long}, etc). * When all usages are of this form, it is never possible to * accidently share a {@code ThreadLocalRandom} across multiple threads." />
      <item value="A random number generator isolated to the current thread. Like the * global {@link java.util.Random} generator used by the {@link * java.lang.Math} class, a {@code ThreadLocalRandom} is initialized * with an internally generated seed that may not otherwise be * modified. When applicable, use of {@code ThreadLocalRandom} rather * than shared {@code Random} objects in concurrent programs will * typically encounter much less overhead and contention. Use of * {@code ThreadLocalRandom} is particularly appropriate when multiple * tasks (for example, each a {@link ForkJoinTask}) use random numbers * in parallel in thread pools." />

If the lock is acquired, * it is held until &lt;code&gt;unlock&lt;/code&gt; is invoked, or until &lt;code&gt;leaseTime&lt;/code&gt; * have passed since the lock was granted - whichever comes first." />

      <item value="Wrapper annotation to allow {@link QueryHint} annotations to be bound to methods.

      <item value="Indicates a query method should be considered as modifying query as that changes the way it needs to be executed. * This annotation is only considered if used on actual query methods (either derived or manually defined through a * {@link Query} annotation).
